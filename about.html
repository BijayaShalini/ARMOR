            <h1>About ARMOR</h1>
            <br>
            <p> Welcome to Armor, a brand where fashion meets faith, founded by Shalom Kalokhe. Our journey began with a simple yet profound vision that is to create clothing that reconnects today's youth with their spiritual roots, reminding them that God is ever-present in their lives.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At Armor, we are more than just a clothing brand. We are a mission, a movement, and a calling. Our founder witnessed firsthand the struggles of young people being led astray by the temptations of alcohol, drugs, crime, and violence. These distractions often overshadow the guiding light of faith and purpose. It was this realization that sparked the idea behind Armor.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We can't wait to see our designs out in the world, helping people carry the word of God with them wherever they go. Armor is more than just a brand; it's a statement. It's a reminder that amidst all the distractions and chaos, there's a higher purpose for each of us. We are all warriors in our own right, and with Armor, we can find and fulfill our divine purpose.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To all the young people out there: know that you are not alone. No matter what challenges you face, God is with you. Through Armor, we hope to remind you of this truth every single day. Wear your faith proudly, and let it guide you towards a life of purpose and fulfillment.
                Thank you for being a part of this journey with us. Together, we can make a difference, one verse at a time.</p>
